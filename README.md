### 👩🏻‍💻 Technical details
This app was my submission for the [Tic Tac Toe Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) in TOP's[^1] Fullstack Javascript path

#### Premise
Create an app that allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe

|Language | Concepts |
|---------| ---------|
| `Javascript` | Array methods<br>IIFE / Factory functions<br>DOM manipulation and event handling<br>Input validation |
| `CSS` | Flexbox<br>Pseudo-classes/elements<br>Custom attributes<br>Basic animation|
  
👀 Please see my [commit history](https://github.com/denaliazhi/tic-tac-toe/commits/main/) for details on my problem-solving process

#### 🔨 Enhancements
If I were to revisit this project at a later date, I'd want to tackle the following:
- Add option to reset game completely, including the scoreboard. In this case, track final scores across games
- Add option to play against a computer. Google suggests using the Minimax algorithm
