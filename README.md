### It's the game and the snack

**Play with your food** in my version of this classic children's game (aka Noughts and Crosses, X's and O's).

### Features:
- Customizable player names
- A scoreboard to track wins across rounds
- A status bar to track whose turn it is, useful if you must pause the round to perform a heroic deed
- Unlimited rounds. Infinite chances to redeem yourself

### Technical details:
This app was my submission for the [Tic Tac Toe Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) in TOP's[^1] Fullstack Javascript path

#### Premise
Create an app that allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe

#### Challenges
- Place a custom tic tac marker on an empty square when it's clicked
- Check rows, columns, and diagonals for wins
- Toggle display of the status messages and `play`/`play again` buttons under board
- Show round outcome for x seconds before replacing message with `play again` button
- Delay resetting board until `play again` is clicked
  
üëÄ Please see my [commit history](https://github.com/denaliazhi/tic-tac-toe/commits/main/) for details on my problem-solving process

#### Enhancements
If I were to revisit this project at a later date, I'd want to tackle the following:
- Add validation for player names (currently, names can be null and if both are null...)
- Add option to reset game completely, including the scoreboard. In this case, track final scores across games
- Add option to play against a computer. Google suggests using the Minimax algorithm
